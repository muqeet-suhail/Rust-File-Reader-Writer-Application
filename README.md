## 📂 Rust File Reader & Writer Application ✏️📖

Welcome to **Rust File Reader & Writer Application**, a simple yet powerful **command-line tool** built in **Rust** for reading from and writing to text files. This project uses **Rust's `std::fs` & `std::io`** modules along with **buffered I/O** for efficient file handling. Whether you want to quickly append some text or read file contents instantly, this tool gets the job done!

<h3> 🚀 Key Features </h3>
